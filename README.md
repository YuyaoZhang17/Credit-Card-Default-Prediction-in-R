# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-in-R

Nowadays, lending credit has increasingly become a popular practice in financial world. But making sure the borrowers paying back and detecting the potential default and loss are the most important among all the other aspects. As machine learning technique coming in, using big data and computer to spot possible default and loss is more reliable and time-saving compared to traditional manual work. In doing so, people are building a bridge between traditional banking, where we are looking at reducing the consumption of economic capital, to an asset-management perspective, where we optimize on the risk to the financial investor.
This project is derived from the kaggle dataset Default Payments of Credit Card Clients in Taiwan in 2005. This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. We will use this dataset to train an efficient and effective model that can detect potential default with similar dataset given. The models we would compare are Neural Network, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine.
